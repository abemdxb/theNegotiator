**ABSTRACT** 

Negotiation is the continuous coordination of the two sides’ joint efforts to expand the interests of both parties. In terms of the relationships between couples or partners, negotiation can be viewed as a special form of communication that  aims  to  achieve  a  win-win  situation  in  which  both  sides  can  feel  satisfied,  and  thereby  the  quality  of  the relationship can be greatly improved. This study, through a review of the pertinent strategic negotiation theories, proposes that the romantic relationship between couples can be constructed by adopting active listening techniques and interest-based bargaining principles. As a result, this review article would theoretically discuss how strategic negotiation strategies can shed lights on couples’ communication and practically put forward an array of suggestions for couples to construct a long-term healthy intimate relationship.

between people, either through words, actions or through  Even  though  the  aforementioned  scenarios  occur other behaviours [1]. In a romantic relationship, namely  more frequently in business settings, they do have huge the  relationships  between  couples  or  partners,  implications  with  regard  to  the  life  issues  between communication can be said as one of the most crucial  couples. During communication between couples, there ways to enhance the quality of relationship for the two  are a lot of bargaining events, with respect to the family sides. Nonetheless, whilst it is well acknowledged that  spending,  house  purchasing,  school  selection  for  the communication is of great significance for constructing a  kids, etc. Such communications, sometimes, can become harmonious  and  sustainable  intimate  relationship.  In  extremely  difficult  if  there  existed  diverged  ideas reality, people  have  witnessed  many  counter-examples  between  the  couple,  and  the  other  party  will  easily regarding how couples can fall into an intensive quarrel  become angry because his or her preferences are not met, due  to  the  inappropriate  or  unsmooth  communication  and their opinions are not respected [1]. Thus, it can be process.  reasonably  argued  that,  those  business  negotiation

previous  studies  with  regard  to  active  listening  and interest-based  negotiation  strategies  are  respectively reviewed and then discussed in romantic relationships. Finally, a conclusion is made in the end to talk about how  future  studies  can  combine  strategic  negotiation theories  so  as  to  make  further  contributions  for communications in daily life.  

2. **THE TACTIC OF ACTIVE LISTENING** 

The first strategic negotiation tactic introduced in this study is “active listening”. Theoretically, listening can be simply  defined  as  a  basic  capability  to  obtain information  through  humans’  hearing  system  [2]. Nevertheless, listening can be either passive or active, depending on the listeners’ own purposes and intentions to obtain  relevant  information. In business  negotiation settings,  active  listening  has  been  proved  as  a  very effective  and  functioning  method  to  enhance  mutual understanding, as it requires the listeners to pay extra attention, to invest in his or her emotions, and to try to understand  the  other's  feelings  by  absorbing  the counterparts’ perceptions [3]. Thereafter, the probability of reaching a consensus would be greatly enhanced.  

More  specifically,  there  are  some  guidelines  and principles to perform active listening. First of all, when actively  listening  to  others,  the  listeners  should  never interrupt people and judge the contents or tones of what they are expressing [4]. Previous psychological research has  shown  that  both  interruptions  and  subjective judgments would lead to extensive dissatisfaction among the parties involved in the communication [4]. Thus, the foremost  premise  to  conduct  active  listening  in  the negotiation is “listening without judging.” 

On  the  other  hand,  despite  that  during  the communication responses are necessary, active listening, however, is not about instantly expressing the opinions when the other person stops talking. True active listening is not only in the manner of attention, but also in the behaviour of  appropriately  respond to  the  other party, with appropriate silence to show that they are digesting the other party's conversation [4]. Meanwhile, the silence time is also significant for both parties to think about the information behind the words.  

Nevertheless,  active  listening  does  not  mean  to always keep silent until the end. Some interruptions and replies may also be performed during the conversation. For instance, previous studies have discussed that how the restatement of others’ words can be beneficial to a clearer understanding of the meaning, as restating what partner said can clarify what the other person was trying to  say  [3].  Meanwhile,  some  follow-up  questions  can also  lead  to  higher  efficiency  of  mutual  understand. Therefore, this implicates that active listening is not only regarding listening but a wise combination of listening and speaking.  

The  success  factors  include  communication  and interpersonal relationship,  and professional  knowledge and  technology.  The  former  accounts  for  85%  of  the total,  while  the  latter  only  accounts  for  15%.  The greatest  achievement  of  mankind  comes  from communication,  and  the  greatest  achievement  comes from  unwillingness  to  communicate.  So,  what  is effective communication like? They have the same ideas, resonate  with  each  other,  reduce  mutual  suspicion, reduce  friction,  politics  and  differences  of  opinion. Effective communication is a common state of mind or emotion.  Effective  communication  is  to  improve  and promote our work level and quality of life. According to the  research  of  Harvard  University,  effective communication  includes  three  parts:  conversation content,  attitude  and  relationship.  Therefore,  effective communication  must  be  skilfully  prepared,  create  an atmosphere and be good at listening. 

3. **ACTIVE  LISTENING  IN  ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS** 

   In accordance with the review in the above section, it can be concluded that active listening can not only be applied  in  business  negotiation,  it  also  has  lots  of implications  for  communication  in  our  daily  life including the communications between couples. While this  tactic  might  be  considered  as  common  sense; however,  during  actual  communications,  actively listening to others may not always be the case. In this situation,  extant  studies  have  discussed  some  reasons causing this issue, and this may further propose insights for couples’ communication. 

The first dimension of the causes is regarding the social-cultural impacts, especially in the eastern Asian cultural  contexts  where  there  is a  relative  high-power distance between the male and female [5]. As discussed in previous studies, the impact of family habit can be huge. If the parents don't show their offspring a good example and often demonstrate quarrelling in front of the  children,  then  these  people  will  not  acquire  an appropriate  pattern  of  listening  and  will  doom  to continue  to  follow  their  parents‘  behavioural  patterns when they start a family in the following life.  

The second dimension of the reasons is about the characters and personalities [5]. According to the human character  typologies,  there  exists  a  certain  group  of people who are individually paranoid and self-centred. When communicating with these types of people, it is highly possible to experience a hard time to ask them to keep  actively  listening,  as  they  tend  to  stubbornly believe  that  their  own  opinions  are  all  correct  and everyone else is wrong. In the marriage, if one of the partners belongs to this type of person or if one is too dominant  and  tries  to  impose  his  or  her  will  on  the others,  then  the  active  listening  may  not  effectively 

happen in the communication. Finally, the problem may occur  due  to  the  other  existing  problems  between  the spouse. If there are some pre-existed issues, or if the two sides already have massive resentment and conflicts, it is difficult to sit down and communicate with each other, or to have the patience to listen to each other.  

The process of communication is a process of mutual communication, and communication is two-way. When we transmit our ideas to others, we should also listen to others. So is listening important for communication? Is learning to listen helpful to communication? Listening can help us get more information. Everyone's level of information  expression  is  different.  Some  people  are used to getting to the point, while others can't get to the point for a long time. For example, customers often ask us all kinds of questions and complaints, but most of the time, customers just want to find someone to vent their negative emotions and don't want to do anything about it. Or  because  in  life  in  a  bad  mood,  see  what  is  not pleasing  to  the  eye,  catch  what  to  take  what  to  vent. These situations need us to listen attentively. 

All in all, it is important to figure out what causes the inactive  listening  behaviours  between  the  couple,  and then  the  efforts  should  be  paid  into  resolving  these problems [5]. During the practice of actual listening, it is possible that the sensitive wordings may trigger feelings of  guilt,  shame,  anxiety  and  defensiveness.  It  is reasonable  that  the  instinct  may  be  to  go  from  being obedient to being rebuttal, wanting to prove the other person  wrong  right  away.  The  conversation  turns  to confrontation. This time listen to each other calmly and rationally, first communicate what the other party wants to talk about, and then discuss the tone and attitude of the other party after both parties calm down. 

4. **INTEREST-BASED NEOGOTIATION** 

Active  listening  is  undoubtedly  a  beneficial communicational strategy that is easy to be understood; however,  sometimes  the  conflict  may  be due  to  more complicated  reasons.  On  this  occasion,  only  a  more comprehensive analysis of the reasons for the conflict can mitigate the conflict. Amid these problems, interest- based bargaining  methods can  be  very  implicative  for this sort of analysis. 

` `By  definition,  interest-based  negotiation  or bargaining is a problem-solving and conflict mitigation approach that focalizes on the common needs and wants rather  than  the  positions  of  the  parties  [6].  More specifically, a position is defined as the “want” itself, while  the  interest  is  why  there  is  a  “want”  [6].  To illustrate what is the interest-based negotiation, the hard approach  (aka.  position-based  approach)  can  be delineated first. 

In  detail,  the  objective  of  positional  bargaining focuses on the positions or the principles rather than the interest  embedded  during  the  negotiation  [7].  For instance,  in  the  inter-governmental  negotiation,  the position  could  be  the  sovereignty  of  the  country,  the belief of religion or the political system of a country. In these scenarios, the positional bargaining may possibly reach a lose-win situation or lead to a zero-sum game in which one partner in the case would have to comprise, whether relentless or willing [7]. 

In  contrast  to  positional  bargaining,  interest-based bargaining  sets out to reach a  win-win  situation. The reasons  that  why  interest-based  bargaining  could perform better in achieving beneficiary results for both sides is that it provides more alternative solutions to a problem [8]. Concerning a conflict or dispute, in many cases, people make decisions due to the latent benefits or interests they want to obtain. However, they may not always be conscious of those interests by themselves, and the lost the focal point of discussion and finally lead to a “dead end”.  

In sum, it can be summarized that the conflict, from the  perspective  of  the  interest-based  negotiation paradigm,  always  means  that  there  is  a  perceived divergence of interest, or a belief that parties’ current aspirations cannot be achieved simultaneously. To solve these divergences, common interests have to be firstly detected and then mutually beneficial agreements could be  made.  In  the  next  section,  these  methods  are discussed  with  the  common  issues  in  romantic relationships in detail. 

5. **INTEREST-BASED  NEGOTIATION  IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP** 

   As has been reviewed, interest-based negotiation can be said an integrative process comprising an array of efforts in finding the agreed interests or common ground underlying the position so as to gain the opportunity to achieve  a  win-win  situation.  The  proposition  of  this approach  is  applicable  to  the  romantic  relationship. Nonetheless, performing such tactic may not be an easy task in the romantic relationships  

As to how to apply this approach to solving conflicts, previous studies have also discussed multiple rules to follow. To begin with, when a conflict seems to occur, it is highly necessary to “delay” it and not to really act a lot for the dispute [8]. It is because that at this moment, people can get very emotional and merely focus on their positions instead of the reasons for conflict. This tactic will  provide  precious  time  for  an  all-around consideration and preparation to solve the conflict.  

After calming down, it is pivotal to take a new look at the problem, and to examine why the conflict would occur, what interests are behind the conflict and what 

are the solutions and evaluation criteria can be used in the negotiation process to meet the needs of both sides [9], which will essentially help open to a new window that leads to a reconsideration of the conflict.  

At  this  stage,  achieving  the  best  solution  to  an interest-based negotiation requires an honest discussion of  conditions  that  can  make  some  alternatives.  The discussion should be made in line with aligned interests reacting as the driving forces for the conflict [9]. If don’t spend time asking for the ‘whys’ beneath the positions, the embedded reasons will be missing.  

A  compromise  and  trade-off  are  necessary  to  be implemented in order to achieve the utmost of interests. Negotiation compromise refers to the understanding and concession action made by one or both parties in order to reach  an  agreement.  Compromise  is  a  negotiation strategy,  its  purpose  is  to  avoid  deadlock  in  the negotiation process, so as to promote the success of the negotiation.  There  are  two  forms  of  negotiation compromise: understanding and concession. These two forms sometimes exist at the same time or separately in the time and content of negotiation, depending on the urgency and prerequisite of the issue. When a problem cannot be solved and is directly related to the subsequent negotiation,  the  understanding  expressed  by  one  party will lead to substantial concession - acceptance of the other party's position and demands; When it is not so urgent, compromise can be interpreted as giving up one's own  attack  and  considering  the  other's  position  and demands.  The  existence  of  compromise  forms  at  two levels  of  understanding  and  concession  provides negotiators  with  the  opportunity  to  examine  the  other party and review the negotiation situation, and also adds colour to the negotiation. 

The results would have to at least impose a positive impact  on  the  interactions  between  husband  and  wife [10]. If no such results can be made at once, it is possible to have a second analysis and discussion until the two sides can obtain positive feelings. Otherwise, the worst scenarios would be avoidance that has to be considered at last if no consensus can be reached. In the field of romantic  relationships,  it  usually  means  divorce  or break-up.  

6. **REFLECTION AND CONCLUSION** 

In conclusion, the intimate relationship is not a war that must determine who wins or who losses. The ideal consequence of a “romantic communication” is that both sides can feel satisfied with the decision. Consequently, as discussed in this article, active listening and interest- based negotiation can be effectively used to solve the conflicts  existing  between  couples,  indicating  the importance  of  strategic  negotiation  principles  in enhancing the romantic relationship quality. Meanwhile, a number of specific strategies have also been posed to 

apply in the communication process between couples. It is believed that as long as these simple principles can be employed, they would have significant positive impacts on the romantic relationship. 

To  restate  aforementioned  negotiation  principles, first,  taking  the  initiative  to  listen  is  always  the cornerstone of communication in a romantic relationship. It is a very simple but efficacious way to strengthen the interpersonal relationships and mutual trust.  

After  that,  if  the  problem  and  conflict  are  still lingering and cannot be solved due to high existence of complexities,  then  an  analysis  of  the  interests  is recommended to be performed, and the solutions should be focalized on the interests rather than the positions. Even though these rules are seemingly easy, in reality, practices are indispensable to be made so as to realize the power of strategic negotiation management theories. Whilst some people are born as good negotiators, the majority  of  people  have  to  specially  acquire  them  as life-long lessons.  

Finally, other than the proposed two strategies in this study, future research could further investigate how to apply  other  negotiation  skills  to  construct  healthy romantic  relationships,  such  as  what  and  how  other business negotiation strategies can positively impact the relationship  between  lovers.  Only  in  this  way,  those unnecessary  harms  and  disputes,  such  as  domestic violence, can be avoided in the society.
