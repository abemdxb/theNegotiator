Preface Contents  **v![ref3]**

Welcome to the sixth edition of *Essentials of Negotiation!* Again, this book represents our response to many faculty who wanted a brief version of the longer text. *Negotiation* (Seventh Edition). The objective of this shorter version is to provide the reader with the core concepts of negotiation in a more succinct presentation. Many faculty requested such a book for use in shorter academic course, executive education programs, or as a companion to other resource materials. It is suitable for courses in negotiation, labor relations, conflict management, human resource management, and the like.

Overview of This Book

The organization of this volume generally follows the more complete Seventh Edition of *Negotiation.* The fundamental difference between this and the Seventh Edition text is that this book contains only 12 chapters, while the complete Seventh Edition contains 20 chapters. The first four chapters have only been minimally shortened for this volume, because we believe that the content is essential to any negotiation course. (The shortening process includes edit- ing out some of the more research-oriented references and descriptions, deleting many of the boxes and sidebars, and occasionally some secondary sections.) Similarly, the last chapter is reproduced in full. The other seven chapters from *Negotiation,* have been included, but shortened by 25–50 percent each.

For the instructor who is not familiar with *Essentials* (the first five editions) or *Negotia- tion* (Seventh or earlier editions), a brief overview is in order. The first five chapters introduce the reader to “Negotiation Fundamentals.” The first chapter introduces the field of negotiation and conflict management, describes the basic problem of interdependence with other people, and briefly explores the challenges of managing that interdependence. Chapters 2 and 3 then present the two core strategic approaches to negotiation: the basic dynamics of competitive (win-lose) bargaining (Chapter 2) and the basic dynamics of integrative (win-win) negotia- tion (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 describes the fundamental prework that negotiators must do to get ready for a negotiation: selecting the strategy, framing the issues, defining negotiation objectives, and planning the steps one will pursue to achieve those objectives. In Chapter 5, we examine the ethical standards and criteria that surround negotiation. The effective negotiator must recognize when ethical questions are relevant and what factors must be considered to address them effectively.

The next three chapters describe the fundamental psychological subprocesses of negotia- tion: perception, cognition, and emotion; communication; and power. In Chapter 6, we review the basic processes of perception, cognition, and emotion in negotiation, we specifically ex- amine common cognitive and judgment biases made by negotiators, and how emotion can affect negotiations. In Chapter 7, we examine communication dynamics. We look at the ways that negotiators communicate their interests, positions and goals, and how this information is communicated to the other. Chapter 8 focuses on power. We look at the capabilities negotia- tors can muster power to pressure the other side, so as to change his or her perspective or give in to our arguments.

![ref4]**vi**  Preface

The next two chapters examine the social contexts in which these negotiations occur, and which also therefore influence how they evolve. In Chapter 9, we examine how the negotiation process changes when the parties have an established relationship with each other, and how the type of relationship affects the negotiation process. We also examine the key roles played by trust, justice and negotiator reputation in shaping negotiations. In Chapter 10, we look at multiparty negotiations, when multiple individuals must work together as a group, team or task force to solve a complex problem or make a decision.

In Chapter 11, we attempt to clarify how international and cross-cultural differences can shape the diverse ways that parties approach negotiations.

Finally, in Chapter 12, we present a new concluding chapter, summarizing the book’s content and offering ten “best practices” principles for all negotiators.

Comparison of This Book to the Fifth Edition of Essentials

- All of this book has been revised and updated. The authors reviewed every chap- ter, utilizing extensive feedback from faculty who have used the book in previous editions. The content in some of the chapters has been reorganized to present the material more effectively.
- The Ethics chapter was moved into the “fundamentals” section as Chapter 5.
- We have further improved the graphics format and page layout of the book to make it visually more interesting and readable.
- We have added learning objectives to the beginning of each chapter.
- The new structure of this book will be paralleled by a major revision to our readings and classroom activities book. *Negotiation: Readings, Exercises, and Cases,* Seventh* Edition, edited by Roy Lewicki, Bruce Barry, and David Saunders to appear in 2015. This text and reader can be used together or separately. We encourage instructors to contact their local McGraw-Hill/Irwin representative for an examination copy (or call 800-634-3963, or visit the Web site at www.mhhe.com).
- Instructional resources, including a test bank, chapter outlines, PowerPoint slides, and extensive assistance on ways that new instructors can improve their teaching of negotiation skills, are available to accompany this volume. Instructors should contact their McGraw-Hill/Irwin representative.

New! LearnSmart and SmartBookTM

LearnSmart is an adaptive study tool proven to strengthen memory recall, increase class re- tention, and boost grades. Students are able to study more efficiently because they are made aware of what they know and don’t know. Real-time reports quickly identify the concepts that require more attention from individual students—or the entire class. SmartBook is the first and only adaptive reading experience designed to change the way students read and learn. It creates a personalized reading experience by highlighting the most impactful concepts a student needs to learn at that moment in time. As a student engages with SmartBook, the read- ing experience continuously adapts by highlighting content based on what the student knows and doesn’t know. This ensures that the focus is on the content he or she needs to learn, while simultaneously promoting long-term retention of material. Use SmartBook’s real-time reports to quickly identify the concepts that require more attention from individual students—or the entire class. The end result? Students are more engaged with course content, can better priori- tize their time, and come to class ready to participate.
